## Sprint 1 Homework

1. Create a CSV file of your choice with combination of string, integer and float data values.
2. Import the CSV file into a dataframe _cities_
3. Display the contents of the dataframe
4. Now delete the last column of the dataframe from the dataframe
5. Now rename the last column to add a prefix "_".  So that if your column is called "age" it will be called "_age"
6. Print the number of columns in a dataframe. Hint: they're also called _keys_.
7. Print the total number of _values_ (cells) in a dataframe
